# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## Working against OpenMakerSuite

ScanTTY is a client of the OpenMakerSuite HTTP API and of ForgeKey; `README.md`
has the env vars and the package map.

- **No live OMS is reachable from a task worktree.** `SCANTTY_OMS_URL` is unset
  and nothing answers locally, so behaviour is verified by driving the real
  screens through `Root.Update` against a stateful `httptest` fake. See
  `internal/tui/wo_materials_drive_test.go` (the `pump` / `key` helpers, reused
  across drive tests) and `internal/tui/po_line_price_test.go`.
- **The OMS source is the contract.** A read-only checkout normally sits beside
  this one at `../openmakersuite`; `backend/<app>/serializers.py` and `views.py`
  are authoritative for wire shapes, and `frontend/src/pages/*.tsx` is
  authoritative for what parity means. Read it before guessing at a payload —
  and never modify it from a ScanTTY task.
- **Money comes over as strings OR numbers**, hence `omsapi.DecimalString`.
  `Empty()` means "null/unset" and NOT "zero": several OMS money properties
  return a real `0.00` for "no price recorded", so treat zero as an absence
  wherever a price is being carried forward (`internal/tui/po_line_price.go`).

### Purchase-order line money has two denominators

A sharp edge worth knowing before touching PO pricing anywhere
(`internal/tui/po_edit.go`, `internal/omsapi/reorders.go`):

    estimated_cost = quantity_ORDERED  × unit_cost_ordered   (derived; 0.00, never null)
    actual_cost    = quantity_RECEIVED × unit_cost_actual    (derived; null until both exist)
    PATCH …/items/{id}/ {"line_cost": X}  ->  unit_cost_actual = X / quantity_ORDERED

So `actual_cost` is not a `line_cost`: feeding one back to the other multiplies a
partially received line's price by `quantity_received / quantity_ordered` on
every trip. `unit_cost_actual` is written ONLY through that endpoint — receiving
never sets it. `internal/tui/po_line_price.go` carries the full note.

## Conventions

- **JD Edwards World interface.** The standing goal is parity with the OMS web
  app in a fixed columnar green-screen style: keyboard only (a barcode scanner
  is a keyboard delivering a burst plus Enter), one shared label column, a
  persistent action bar naming exactly the keys that work where the cursor is.
  `internal/tui/jde_form.go` is the shared layer; `internal/tui/po_edit.go` is
  the pilot and `po_edit_jde_test.go` is where the layout and key scheme are
  pinned. Extend that layer — do not hand-roll a second style beside it.
- **A key the bar does not name must do nothing**, and a key it names must do
  something. Tests assert both.
- **80 columns leaves the pane 51.** `screenBodyWidth(80)` is
  `80 - navColumnWidth(24) - 1 - padding(4)` = **51**, and the action bar gets 49
  of them. That is the number every columnar layout has to be checked against,
  and it is small enough that a hint, a six-column grid or a long value will not
  fit without help — `jdeFitRow`, `poFitLineGrid` and `jdeCaveatLines` in
  `jde_form.go` / `po_detail.go` are the three folds that exist for it.
- **Check the CLIPPED render.** `clampToBox` truncates in `Root.View()`, not in
  the screen, so a test that reads `screen.View()` passes while the terminal
  shows a cut line. Assert against `Root.View()` at 80/100/120 —
  `internal/tui/po_view_jde_test.go` is the pattern (and `poSeenWhileScrolling`
  for a body taller than the pane).
- **Viewing screens** use the read-only half of the columnar layer:
  `jdeScreen.frameScrolled` (scroll offset, not a cursor) and
  `renderActionBarWrapped` (a bar of a dozen order-level keys folds onto several
  rows rather than losing its tail). `internal/tui/po_detail.go` is the pilot for
  those, as `po_edit.go` is for forms.
- Comments in this codebase explain WHY, at length, including the failure that
  motivated the rule. Match that density.

## Gotchas

- **`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` does not isolate anything on macOS.** `defaultPrefsPath()`
  and `defaultCachePath()` use `os.UserConfigDir()`/`os.UserCacheDir()`, which on
  darwin resolve under `$HOME/Library` and ignore the XDG variables entirely. A
  test that only sets `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` therefore writes the developer's real
  prefs file and fails on its second run; set `HOME` as well. `internal/config/prefs_test.go`'s
  `setRequiredConfigEnv` does this and is what any new config test should call.
- `gofmt -l` flags a few pre-existing files (doc-comment backtick rewrites).
  Format only what you touch.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
